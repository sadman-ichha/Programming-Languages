This document provides a detailed explanation of the `Hello.java` program, which prints "Hello World!" to the console.

  

## Code

  

```java

class  Hello {
	public  static  void  main(String [] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}
}

```

  

## Breakdown of the Code

  

### Class Definition

  

```java

class  Hello {

```

- This line defines a class named `Hello`.

- In Java, every application begins with a class definition.

- A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It can contain fields (variables) and methods to define its behavior.

  

### Main Method

  

```java

public  static  void  main(String args[]) {

```

- This line declares the `main` method.

- The `main` method is the entry point of any Java application. When you run a Java program, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for this method to start execution.

-  `public`: The method is accessible from anywhere.

-  `static`: The method belongs to the class, not to any specific instance of the class. This means it can be called without creating an object of the class.

-  `void`: The method does not return any value.

-  `main`: The name of the method. This name is special in Java and indicates the starting point of the program.

-  `String args[]`: This is a parameter of the `main` method. It's an array of `String` objects that stores command-line arguments passed to the program. Even if you don't use command-line arguments, this parameter must be included in the method definition.

  

### Printing to the Console

  

```java

System.out.println("Hello World!");

```

- This line prints the text "Hello World!" to the console.

-  `System`: A built-in class that contains useful methods and variables, including the standard input and output streams.

-  `out`: A static member of the `System` class, which is an instance of `PrintStream`. It represents the standard output stream (typically, the console).

-  `println`: A method of `PrintStream` class that prints a line of text to the console. The text to be printed is passed as a parameter to this method.

  

### Closing Braces

  

```java

}

```

- These braces close the `main` method and the `Hello` class respectively.

  

## Summary

  

- The `Hello` class contains a single method, `main`, which is the entry point of the program.

- When the program runs, it calls the `main` method, which executes the statement to print "Hello World!" to the console.

  

## Example of How to Use the Code

  

1.  **Save the Code**:

- Save the code in a file named `Hello.java`.

  

2.  **Compile the Code**:

- Open a terminal or command prompt.

- Navigate to the directory where `Hello.java` is saved.

- Compile the code using the following command:

```sh

javac Hello.java

```

- This command will generate a file named `Hello.class`.

  

3.  **Run the Program**:

- Run the compiled code using the following command:

```sh

java Hello

```

- This command will execute the `main` method and print "Hello World!" to the console
