/*
   Comments in Dart:

   1. Single-line comments start with // and extend to the end of the line.
   2. Multi-line comments are enclosed within /* and */ and can span multiple lines.

   Use comments to:
   - Provide explanations about the purpose of your code.
   - Document complex algorithms or logic.
   - Add TODOs for future improvements or tasks.
   - Share insights with collaborators or contributors.

   Examples:

   // Single-line comment

   /*
      Multi-line comment
      It can span multiple lines and is useful for longer explanations.
   */

   // Dart also supports documentation comments for generating documentation.
   // Use triple slashes (///) or triple stars (/** */) for documentation comments.

   /// This is a documentation comment for a function.
   /// It provides information about parameters, return values, and usage.

   Happy coding!
*/
void main() {
  // Output a simple message
  print("Hello, GitHub!");
}
